It is a simple web api which can perfrom GET,POST,PUT,DELETE operation 
created as a part of my SoftwareDev Lab home task.I used **Java Spring Boot** + **MongoDB Atlas** to design this

It is hosted on **heroku** as a **live API** and it can be use by the
following link [Department Info](https://department-info.herokuapp.com/Students/)
